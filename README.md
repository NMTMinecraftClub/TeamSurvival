# TeamSurvival
###Team Survival event, by the NMT Minecraft Club

Team Assignments have been made. For more information, contact Franz @ chavezfk@gmail.com

####Teams should work on their own separate branch.
Before running any of these commands in Bash or GitShell, please be sure to clone the repository. If you are unfamiliar with this shell please refer to the Tutorial Links section of this readme.

If you are familiar with git but may not be familiar with working in separate branches here are the commands:

To create a branch:
```Shell
git branch [branch name]
```

To change branches:
```Shell
git checkout [branch name]
```

###Commit Standards
* Please commit and push to **your team's branch** using:
```Shell
git push origin [branch name]
```
* Your commit messages should be insightful into what changes you made
* **DO NOT PUSH TO ORIGIN MASTER**
If your changes are ready to be put into the Master Branch, navigate to this repository and **submit a pull request**.
