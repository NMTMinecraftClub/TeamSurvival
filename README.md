Work on your own branch, then merge to master. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this:
  //after you have cloned the projeect to your local machine and are cd'ed into it
  git branch players // replace players with whatever you wanna call your branch. has to be unique
  git checkout players //use the same thing as you did above
  
After this, you'll be on your own branch. Work like normal. Then, once you're ready to REALLY commit the changed to the
master branch where everyone can see it, merge them. The easiest and most efficient for review way is to:
  get on github
  go to this repo
  submit a pull request
    get the branch thing all set up on the top of he form
